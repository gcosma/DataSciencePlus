To check if you are using those Tailwind directives (`@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, `@tailwind utilities;`):

1. **Check your build setup:**  
    - If you have Tailwind CSS installed (look for `tailwindcss` in your `package.json`).
    - If your project uses PostCSS (look for a `postcss.config.js` file with `tailwindcss` as a plugin).

2. **Check your import:**  
    - In your main JS/TS file (like `index.js`, `main.jsx`, or `App.js`), you should see an import for your CSS file:
      ```js
      import './App.css';
      ```
    - This ensures the CSS (and thus Tailwind) is included in your app.

3. **Check your HTML/JSX:**  
    - If you use Tailwind utility classes (like `className="bg-blue-500 p-4"`), you are using Tailwind.

If all these are true, you are using those lines and need them. If not, you can remove them.
